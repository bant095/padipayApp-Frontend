# Welcome to  PadiPay!
This guide will walk you through the process of contributing to this project. You'll learn how to clone the repository, create a new branch, push your changes, install dependencies, run the project, and make a pull request.

## Clone the repository
To get started, you need to clone the project repository to your local machine. 
- Open a terminal or command prompt
- Change to the directory where you want to clone the repository
- Run the following command to clone the repository

``` git clone https://github.com/bant095/padipayApp-Frontend.git```
- Once cloning is complete, change to the repository's directory using
  
```cd PadiPayReact-General```

CongratulationsðŸŽ‰! You have successfully cloned the repository to your local machine.

### Install the project dependencies using npm:
Before running the project, you need to install its dependencies. Run the following command in the project directory:

```npm install```

## Run the following command to create a new branch and switch to it:
git checkout -b <branch-name>

Replace <branch-name> with a descriptive name for your branch, such as yourName/the page you worked on

Great!ðŸŽ‰ You have created and switched to a new branch.


### Run the Project
You can now run the project on your local environment with the following command:

``` npm run start ```

The server will start and be accessible at http://localhost:3000

## Make Changes and Commit
**Now that you have your branch, you can start making changes to the code. Once you are ready to commit your changes, follow these steps:**
- Make the necessary modifications to the code using your preferred editor or IDE.
- After you have made your changes, stage them for commit by running the following command:

``git add .``

This command stages all the modified files. If you want to stage specific files, replace . with the file names.
- Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message using the following command:

``git commit -m "Your commit message"``

Replace "Your commit message" with a brief and meaningful message that explains the changes you made.

Excellent work! You have committed your changes to the branch.

## Push Changes to the Remote Repository
To share your changes with others and collaborate, you need to push your branch to the remote repository. Follow these steps to push your changes:
Run the following command to push your branch to the remote repository:

``git push -u origin <branch-name>``

Replace <branch-name> with the name of your branch.

If this is your first time pushing the branch, use the -u flag to set the upstream branch. This enables you to use git pull and git push without specifying the branch name in the future.

Congratulations! Your changes have been pushed to the remote repository.

## Creating a Pull Request
Once you have pushed your branch to the remote repository, you can open a pull request to propose your changes for review and merge. Here's how:
- Visit the repository's page on the Git hosting platform.
- Click on the "Pull Request" or "New Pull Request" button.
- Select your branch from the branch dropdown menu.
- Provide a descriptive title and description for your pull request, outlining the changes made.
- Review your pull request and, if everything looks good, submit it for review.
- That's it! You have successfully created a pull request for your changes.

P.S: Please in all you do, do not push to the main branch. Namaste
